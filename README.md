# AITU_Daulet ERC-20 Token with Web3

This Web3-based code facilitates Ethereum transactions using the Web3 library.

## Usage

ERC-20 tokens are digital assets created and transacted on the Ethereum blockchain using a specific standard called ERC-20. And this Web3 based code is used to interact with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network.


Thanks to the functions in my web3 app, after deploying the contract the user can call the functions of the contract itself in Web3.

### Examples

For example, you can obtain various data about the contract and transfers using the available contract functions in addition to the addresses of senders and recipients (e.g. latestTransferHumanReadable(), etc.)
